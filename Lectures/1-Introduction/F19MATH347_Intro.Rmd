# Interpretation of probability and Bayes' Rule

## Motivating Bayesian Inference

- Significance tests and confidence intervals are forms of
  \textcolor{VassarRed}{classical} or \textcolor{VassarRed}{frequentist} inference.

- When might classical inference be inadequate?
    - Suppose you flip a coin (with unknown probability of heads) three times and get tails all three times.
    - The sample percentage of heads equals zero.  But, this can't be an accurate estimate of the
  true percentage of heads!
    - \underline{A priori} of flipping the coin, we believe the true percentage is around 0.5, not 0.0.

\pause

- Bayesian inference provides a formal method for quantifying and
  incorporating our prior beliefs into inference.



## Why Bayesian statistics?

- Long history: named after the $18^{th}$ century Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes (1701 - 1761).

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '15%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Thomas_Bayes.png")
```

<!-- # ```{r, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- # url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes#/media/File:Thomas_Bayes.gif" -->
<!-- # ``` -->
\pause

- Modeling: incorporate prior belief or domain experts knowledge.

- Theoretical: doesn't need large sample assumption.

- Computational: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

Bayesian approaches are largely popularized by revolutionary advance in computational technology during the last twenty five years (the invention of Gibbs sampler around 1990 - we will read a research paper about it later).

## Two schools of statistics cont'd

Example 1: A study on several different, but similar populations, for each of which is needed an estimate of variability. How should one use the important prior information that the populations are similar?

\pause

- \underline{Frequentist/classical}: deciding between separate estimates of variance or a pooled variance $\rightarrow$ very crude utilization of the prior information

- \underline{Bayesian}: techniques such as hierarchical Bayesian analysis to use the same distribution for all variances $\rightarrow$ allows much more efficient use of such prior information
    
## Two schools of statistics cont'd

Example 2: A 95\% confidence interval of an unknown parameter $\theta$, interpretation? An interval that has probability of 0.95 of containing $\theta$?

\pause

 \underline{Frequentist/classical}: NO $\rightarrow$ indirectly related to the probability of the hypothesis
 
 \underline{Bayesian}: YES $\rightarrow$ directly related to the probability of the hypothesis

## Two schools of statistics cont'd

Two issues in the previous Example 2:

- Philosophically pragmatic: what is the best way of quantifying uncertainty?

- Pragmatically pragmatic: how statistical users (laymen) interpret statistical conclusions? How much work does it take for statistics educators to explain the correct interpretations of p-values and confidence intervals?


## Two schools of statistics cont'd

Remarks:

- Not everyone has taken a mathematical statistics or classical statistical inference course, therefore in this course we wonâ€™t emphasize more on the differences and comparisons between frequentist/classcial statistics and Bayesian statistics.

- We will think like a Bayesian for the entire semester.

- For those of you who had frequentist statistics training before, please think broadly and feel free to ask questions and/or start a discussion with the entire class (on Moodle)!


## Toy example: procedure of Bayesian inference
Goal: making inference for an unknown quantity

\vspace{5mm}
\pause
Inference procedure:

- Before seeing any data, we have \textcolor{VassarRed}{prior probability}: P(hypothesis)

\pause

- Collect data

\pause

- After collecting data, we update our probability of the hypothesis given the data we just observed. It is called \textcolor{VassarRed}{posterior probability}: P(hypothesis $|$ data)

\pause

\vspace{5mm}

Note that the frequentist p-value is P(data $|$ hypothesis), the probability of observed or more extreme data given the null hypothesis being true.



## Toy example: breast cancer screening

- American Cancer Society estimates that about 1.7\% of women have breast cancer. 
\small\webURL{http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancerbasics/cancer-prevalence}

- Susan G. Komen For The Cure Foundation states that mammography correctly identifies about 78\% of women who truly have breast cancer. 
\small\webURL{http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/AccuracyofMammograms.html}

- An article published in 2003 suggests that up to 10\% of all mammograms are false positive. \small \webURL{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360940}

\vfill

\Note{These percentages are approximate, and very difficult to estimate.}


## Toy example: determining the prior

\disc{Prior to any testing and any information exchange between the patient and the doctor, what probability should a doctor assign to a female patient having breast cancer?}

\pause

\vspace{1cm}
0.017


## Toy example: calculating the posterior

\disc{When a patient goes through breast cancer screening there are two competing claims: patient had cancer and patient doesn't have cancer. If a mammogram yields a positive result, what is the probability that patient has cancer, i.e. what is the posterior probability of having cancer if mammogram yield a positive result?}

\pause


\begin{align*}
&P(c | +) = \frac{P(C~and~+)}{P(+)} \\
&= \frac{0.017 \times 0.78}{0.017 \times 0.78 + 0.983 \times 0.1} \\
&= 0.12
\end{align*}



## Toy example: updating the prior

- In the Bayesian approach, we evaluate claims iteratively as we collect more data $\rightarrow$ sequential update.

\pause

- In the next iteration (screening) we get to take advantage of what we learned from the data.

\pause

- In other words, we \textcolor{VassarRed}{update} our prior with our posterior probability from the previous iteration.


## Toy example: updating the prior when retesting

\disc{Suppose this woman who got a positive result in the first test wants to get tested again. What should the new prior probability that this woman has cancer? Is this probability smaller, larger, or equal to the prior probability in the first test? Why?}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 0.017
\item 0.12
\item 0.0133
\item 0.88
\end{enumerate}

\pause

Answer: (b)

## Toy example: re-calculating the posterior when retesting

\disc{What is the posterior probability of having cancer if this second mammogram also yielded a positive result?}


\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item 0.0936
\item 0.088
\item 0.48
\item 0.52
\end{enumerate}

\pause

Answer: (d)

\vspace{3mm}

$$
P(c | +) = \frac{P(c~and~+)}{P(+)} = \frac{0.12 \times 0.78}{0.12 \times 0.78 + 0.88 \times 0.1} = 0.52
$$


## Toy example: recap of Bayesian inference

- Take advantage of prior information, like a previously published study or a physical model.

\pause

- Naturally integrate data as you collect it, and update your priors.

\pause

- Avoid the counter-intuitive Frequentist definition of a p-value as the P(observed or more extreme outcome $|$ $H_0$ is true). Instead base decisions on the posterior probability, P(hypothesis is true $|$ observed data).

\pause

- \textcolor{VassarRed}{Watch out!}
A good prior helps, a bad prior hurts, but the prior matters less the more data you have.

\pause

- More advanced Bayesian techniques offer flexibility not present in Frequentist models.


# Bayesian inference

## What is fixed, $Y$ or $\theta$?

Both frequentist and Bayesian aim to use data $Y$ to learn about the unknown parameter $\theta$.

\underline{Frequentist}:
{\Large
$$

$$
}
{\small{
\begin{itemize}
\item Data are a repeatable random sample
\item Underlying parameters remain constant during this repeatable process
\item \textcolor{VassarRed}{Parameters $\theta$ are fixed}
\end{itemize}
}}
}

\underline{Bayesian}:

{\small{
\begin{itemize}
\item Data are observed from the realized sample
\item Parameters are unknown and described probabilistically
\item \textcolor{VassarRed}{Data $Y$ are fixed}
\end{itemize}
}}
}


## Extending to statistical analysis
Bayes Theorem extends naturally to parameters in statistical
inference.

- ``Characteristics'' are akin to parameters $\theta$ in probability
  models, e.g.,  $\theta=p$ in the Binomial distribution $\textrm{Binomial}(n, p)$.
  
- ``Data'' are akin to measurements on sampled data subjects expressed
  numerically, say $y$.
  
- Before the sample is collected, both $y$ and $\theta$ are unknown.

- ``Model for data'' is akin to a probability model for $Y$
     assuming we know $\theta$, e.g., $Y \sim \textrm{Binomial}(n, p)$.
     
- We express prior information about $\theta$ as a (different) probability model.


## Bayesian inference

Bayesian inference provides a formal approach for updating prior beliefs with the observed data to quantify
uncertainty *a posteriori* about $\theta$.

- Prior distribution $\pi(\theta )$

- Sampling model $f(y \mid \theta)$

- Posterior distribution:

$$ \pi(\theta \mid y) = \frac{ f(y \mid \theta) \, \pi(\theta)}{f(y)}
= \frac{ f(y \mid \theta) \, \pi(\theta)}
 {\int_{\Theta}  f(Y \mid \tilde{\theta})\pi(\tilde{\theta})d\tilde{\theta}}
$$

(for discrete support for $\theta$ replace integral with sum)


## Bayesian inference for proportion

- What percentage $p$ of all Vassar students stayed up at least one night to get school work done last academic year.

- Suppose we sample ten MATH 347 students and ask whether they stayed up at least one night last academic year.

\pause

- Let's build a (simplified) prior distribution and use Bayesian inference to learn about $\theta = p$.

- We will make the (incorrect) assumption that the sample is representative of Vassar
  students at large, since this is just an illustration of ideas.
  

## Prior distribution

We will use the unrealistic but instructive prior distribution defined
by consensus of the class:

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(p = 0) = \,\,\,\,\, & P(p = 0.1) = \,\,\,\,\,  & P(p = 0.2) = \\
P(p = 0.3) = \,\,\,\,\, & P(p = 0.4) = \,\,\,\,\,  & P(p = 0.5) = \\
P(p = 0.6) = \,\,\,\,\, & P(p = 0.7) = \,\,\,\,\, & P(p = 0.8) =  \\
P(p = 0.9) = \,\,\,\,\, & P(p = 1.0) = \,\,\,\,\, &  \\
\end{eqnarray*}

We'll do the posterior probability calculation following the All_nighters_example.Rmd (available on Moodle).


## Analsyis goals

Bayesian methods go beyond the formal updating of the prior
distribution to obtain a posterior distribution:

- Estimation of uncertain quantities (parameters) with
  good statistical properties.
  
- Prediction of future events.

- Tests of hypotheses.

- Making decisions.


# Probability review


## Events and partitions

\begin{defn}
A collection of sets $\{H_1, \cdots, H_k\}$ is a \textcolor{VassarRed}{partition} of another set $\mathcal{H}$ if

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] the events are disjoint, which we write as $H_i \cap H_j = \emptyset$ for $i \neq j$;
\item[2.] the union of the sets is $\mathcal{H}$, which we write as $\cup_{k=1}^K H_k = \mathcal{H}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\vspace{5mm}

Examples?


## Partitions and probability

Suppose $\{H_1, \cdots, H_K\}$ is a partition of $\mathcal{H}$, $Pr(\mathcal{H}) = 1$, and $E$ is some specific event. The \textcolor{VassarRed}{axioms of probability} imply:

- Rule of total probability
$$
\sum_{k=1}^{K} Pr(H_k) = 1
$$

- Rule of marginal probability
$$
Pr(E) = \sum_{k=1}^K Pr(E \cap H_k) = \sum_{k=1}^K Pr(E \mid H_k)Pr(H_k)
$$

- Bayes' rule
$$
Pr(H_j|E) = \frac{Pr(E \mid H_j)Pr(H_j)}{Pr(E)} = \frac{Pr(E \mid H_j)Pr(H_j)}{\sum_{k=1}^KPr(E \mid H_k)Pr(H_k)}
$$



## In Bayesian inference

- $\{H_1, \cdots, H_K\}$: disjoint hypotheses or states of nature.

- $E$: the outcome of a survey, study or experiment.

To compare hypotheses post-experimentally $Pr(H_i \mid E)$ v.s. $Pr(H_j \mid E)$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \frac{Pr(H_i \mid E)}{Pr(H_j \mid E)} &=& \frac{Pr(E \mid H_i)Pr(H_i)/Pr(E)}{Pr(E \mid H_j)Pr(H_j)/Pr(E)} \\ \pause
    &=& \frac{Pr(E \mid H_i)Pr(H_i)}{Pr(E \mid H_j)Pr(H_j)}  \\ \pause
    &=& \frac{Pr(E \mid H_i)}{Pr(E \mid H_j)} \times \frac{Pr(H_i)}{Pr(H_j)} \\
    &=& \textcolor{VassarRed}{"Bayes \, factor"} \times \textcolor{VassarRed}{"prior \, beliefs"}
\end{eqnarray*}

\pause

Bayes' rule does not determine what our beliefs should be after seeing the data. It tells us how they should \textcolor{VassarRed}{change} after seeing the data.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


## Conditional distribution

$$
f_{X \mid Y}(x \mid y) = \frac{f(x,y)}{f_Y(y)}
$$

- Joint density $f(x,y)  = f(x \mid y)f_Y(y) = f(y \mid x)f_X(x)$

\pause

\textcolor{VassarRed}{Conditional expectation}

- $E(X \mid Y=y) = \sum_x f(x \mid y)$  or $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x \mid y)dx$ 
- Law of total expectation
$$
E_Y\left[ E(X \mid Y) \right] = E(X)
$$

\textcolor{VassarRed}{Conditional variance}

- $Var(X \mid Y = y) = E[(X - E[X \mid Y = y])^2 \mid Y = y]$

- A very useful conditional variance formula
$$
Var(X) = E[Var(X \mid Y)] + Var(E[X \mid Y])
$$


## Transformation of variables

Suppose X is a continuous random variable with pdf $f_X(x)$. If a function $g(x)$ is

- monotonic (increasing or decreasing), and
- differentiable (and thus continuous),

then the random variable defined by $Y = g(X)$ has pdf

$$
f_Y ( y ) = f_X( x )  \left|\frac{dx}{dy}\right|
$$

\pause

Or more rigorously,

\begin{align*}
f_Y ( y ) =
  \begin{cases}
  f_X\left[ g^{-1}(y) \right] \cdot \left|\frac{d}{dy}g^{-1}(y)\right| & \text{ if } y = g(x) \text{ for some } x \\
  0 													 & \text{ if } y \neq g(x) \text{ for all } x \\
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}


## _

\disc{Example: let $X \sim \text{Unif}(0, 1)$, what distribution does $Y = -\ln(X)$ have? (Hint: monotonic \& differentiable, then $f_Y ( y ) = f_X( x )  \left|\frac{dx}{dy}\right|$)}

## Independent random variables

\begin{defn}
\small{
Suppose $Y_1, \cdots, Y_n$ are random variables and that $\theta$ is a parameter describing the conditions under which the random variables are generated. We say that $Y_1, \cdots, Y_n$ are \textcolor{VassarRed}{conditionally independent} given $\theta$ if for every collection of n sets $\{A_1, \cdots, A_n\}$ we have
$$Pr(Y_1 \in A_1, \cdots, Y_n \in A_n \mid \theta) = Pr(Y_1 \in A_1 \mid \theta) \times \cdots \times Pr(Y_n \in A_n \mid \theta)$$

Under independence, the joint density is the product of the marginal densities
$$
f(y_1, \cdots, y_n \mid \theta) = f_{Y_1}(y_1 \mid \theta) \times \cdots \times f_{Y_n}(y_n \mid \theta) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}f_{Y_i}(y_i \mid \theta)

Y_1, \cdots, Y_n \mid \theta \stackrel{iid}{\sim} f(y \mid \theta)

\disc{Example: let $Y_1, \cdots, Y_n \mid \mu, \sigma \stackrel{iid}{\sim} \textrm{Normal}(\mu, \sigma)$, write out the joint density of $f(Y_1, \cdots, Y_n \mid \mu, \sigma)$. (Hint: the Normal pdf is $f(Y_i = y_i \mid \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}}\exp(-\frac{(y_i - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})$)}

\begin{eqnarray*}
f(Y_1 = y_1, \cdots, Y_n = y_n \mid \mu, \sigma) &=& \prod_{i=1}^n f_{Y_i}(y_i \mid \mu, \sigma) \\
                                                 &=& \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}}\exp \left(-\frac{(y_i -   \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) \\
                                                 &=& \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}}\right)^n \exp \left(-\frac{\sum (y_i - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}


## Exchangeablility

Let $f(y_1, \ldots, y_n)$ be the joint distribution of
$Y_1, \ldots, Y_n$ and let $\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_n$ be a permutation of
the indices $1, \ldots, n$. If $f(y_1, \ldots, y_n) = f(y_{\pi_1}, \ldots, y_{\pi_n})$  for all
permutations, then $Y_1, \ldots, Y_n$ are \textcolor{VassarRed}{exchangeable}.

\vspace{.25in}
{\bf de Finetti's Theorem} $Y_1, \cdots, Y_n$  be a sequence of random variables.
If for any $n$, $Y_1, \cdots, Y_n$ are exchangeable, then there exists a
prior distribution $\pi(\theta)$ and sampling model $f(y \mid \theta)$
such that
$$
f(y_1, \ldots, y_n) = \int_\Theta \left\{ \prod_1^n f(y_i \mid \theta) \right\} \pi(\theta)\, d \theta
$$


## Models

$$ 
\left. \begin{array}{l} Y_1, \ldots Y_n \mid \theta \stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim} p(y \mid
  \theta) \\
\theta \sim p(\theta)
\end{array} \right\} \Longleftrightarrow  Y_1, \ldots Y_n \text{ are exchangeable for
  all } n
$$
\vspace{5mm}

Applicable if $Y_1, \ldots, Y_n$ are

- outcomes of a repeatable experiment
- random sample from finite population with replacement
- sampled from an infinite population w/out replacement
- sampled from a finite population of size $N >> n$ w/out
  replacement (approximate)
